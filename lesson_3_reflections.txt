When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository when working with other people and a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

That way we only pull meaningful changes to Git instead of having every little change being pulled to Git which would be very uncessesary.
