When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository when working with other people and a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

That way we only pull meaningful changes to Git instead of having every little change being pulled to Git which would be very uncessesary.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is used to copy a repositories within GitHub. Clone is used to copy repositories from GitHub to your local repository and also to clone repositories locally. Branches are completely different and are used to have different versions of your code without affecting each other. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This way if we are offline we can keep working on the latest version of the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Everything would be harder. I would have to keep sending my collaborators my code through something like dropbox and it would be very hard to work on the code at the same time and then trying to merge them. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When working on a new feature with a friends. This has the benefit of not possibly leaving the master broken and having all the freedom to experiment on this new branch.
